# ReforgeLite Plus (MoP Classic)

## INFO
This project is based on the last publicly available MIT-licensed version of “ReforgeLite”.
The original author has since changed the license to All Rights Reserved (ARR).
I fully respect this decision and do not use any code from the ARR versions.

Due to the license change of the original project, this fork will no longer be developed to avoid future conflicts.
Existing code remains available under the original MIT license.
